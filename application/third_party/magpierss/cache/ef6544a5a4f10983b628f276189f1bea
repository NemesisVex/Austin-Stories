<p>Nothing strange so far, right?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the same sentence in a <code>&lt;span/&gt;</code> tag with a <code>style</code> attribute specifying Helvetica, Verdana and Arial fonts: <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica', 'Verdana', 'Arial', sans-serif">このセンテンスは日本語で書いた。</span></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re using Google Chrome, you may not even see the sentence at all. It will, however, render when you view the source code.</p>
<p>Curious to know why some parts of my sites render Japanese text and others do not, I started inspecting elements with Japanese text in Chrome, enabling and disabling rules. When I disabled <tt>font-family</tt> rules specifying sans-serif fonts, the Japanese text re-appeared. Enabling the sans-serif rule made them disappear again.</p>
<p><span id="more-255"></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;m running a Windows XP machine, and when I opened up the Character Map to see what extended characters Helvetica supports, I saw a sea of dots. Verdana and Arial supported extended Western characters but no Asian characters. (Arial Unicode MS does support Asian characters.)</p>
<p>It looks like Chrome is pretty literal about how it renders fonts &#8212; if it encounters a character the font doesn&#8217;t support, it&#8217;s not going to render it. In fact, it won&#8217;t even bother trying to render an analogous sans-serif Japanese font.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s our same example sentence with a <code>style</code> attribute specifying a sans-serif <code>font-family</code>: <span style="font-family: sans-serif">このセンテンスを書いた。</span></p>
<p>Firefox and Internet Explorer look like they substitute fonts to render sans-serif Japanese text, probably falling back on MS PGothic.</p>
<p>If you want a mix of English and Japanese text to render with a sans-serif font in Google Chrome, it looks like you have to specify those sans-serif fonts in your CSS.</p>
<p>Example: <span style="font-family: 'MS PGothic', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Helvetica', 'Arial', sans-serif">This sentence mixes 日本語 and 英語 with Arial MS Unicode and MS PGothic specified in the <tt>font-family</tt>.</span></p>
<p>Of course, this means your English text is also rendered in Arial Unicode MS or MS PGothic, which pales next Helvetica. And Mac users? Well, that&#8217;s an entire cross-platform can of worms I haven&#8217;t even tested.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE, 06/01/2010, 0917:</strong> Of course, this site uses UTF-8 for character encoding. If a site uses Shift-JIS or EUC-JP, these problems may not be an issue.</p>
<p>Also, the examples may not adequately demonstrate the sans-serif issue, so here are more examples using <code>&lt;h1/&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Sans-serif specified in <code>font-family</code>:</p>
<h1 style="font-family: sans-serif">日本語</h1>

<p>The Carnegie Hall web site makes a <a href="http://www.carnegiehall.org/article/the_basics/art_directions.html">coy reference</a> to that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Hall#Carnegie_Hall_Joke">age-old joke</a>, &quot;How do you get to Carnegie Hall?&quot; The reply: practice.</p>
<p>If you want to improve a skill &#8212; be it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">C#</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%E2%99%AF_(musical_note)">C-Sharp</a> &#8212; you need to practice. To become a master at that particular skill, you need to practice for 10,000 hours.</p>
<p>Malcolm Gladwell seems <a href="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23588962-the-secret-of-your-success-10000-hours.do">to get all the press</a> regarding this figure, but Daniel J. Levitan mentioned it first in his book, <em><a href="http://www.yourbrainonmusic.com/">This Is Your Brain on Music</a></em>. Levitan says it&#8217;s a well-researched figure, and I haven&#8217;t scoured the footnotes of the book to verify. Intuitively, it makes sense.</p>
<p><span id="more-252"></span></p>
<p>10,000 hours sounds like a pretty big figure, but let&#8217;s break it down in terms of something concrete in daily life &#8212; the 40-hour work week. Divide 10,000 hours by 40 hours/week, and you get 250 weeks. Divide 250 weeks by 52 weeks/year, and you get 4.81 years. Figure in lunch hours, coffee breaks, that&#8217;s roughly 5 years of 9-to-5 work. (Assuming you&#8217;re actually productive during all eight hours of a work day. Those five years are probably spread out over six, seven if you&#8217;re a real slacker.)</p>
<p>So, yes, there&#8217;s a reason employers seek at least five years of experience for their positions &#8212; consciously or not, they&#8217;re looking for masters.</p>
<p>The quality of the practice matters. I had a piano teacher in college who advocated a method of &quot;perfect practice&quot; &#8212; he taught that if you played a passage of music perfectly during rehearsal, your performance will be likewise perfect. (Classical music is all about fidelity to the score.) If you spent five years doing something incorrectly, you&#8217;ll be a master of doing it incorrectly.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s where passion and professionalism affect the picture. Passion is needed to make those 10,000 hours feel engaging. If you&#8217;re an accountant who hates being an accountant, five years is going to feel like a lifetime. Professionalism, as defined by Mark, is actually the same thing Soon describes without the hyperbolic language. Whatever it&#8217;s called, you&#8217;re going to need it to reach that mastery.</p>
<p>And really &#8230; if you spend that much time being engaged (and not getting burned out), then yes, it may seem like passion/professionalism should take all the credit. It doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been building web sites from the ground up since 2000. Numerically, I ought to be a master at it, and by some accounts, I am. I like what I do, and on the days I don&#8217;t, I take solace knowing it doesn&#8217;t annoy me as much as, say, working at a newspaper would. (I&#8217;ve done that.) But I have interests beyond programming, some dating back further than when I became a programmer.</p>
<p>Do I lack passion, then? Probably not. But I&#8217;ve got something that has kept me going for the last 10 years, and even if I never set out to master my programming skills, it doesn&#8217;t mean I may not end up doing so.</p>

<p>There are a lot of places on the Interwebs where you can find out about video resolutions and the first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video#Display_resolution">two</a> <a href="http://hometheater.about.com/cs/television/a/aavideoresa.htm">links</a> provided by Google are good places to start.</p>
<p>Assuming you can get through all the jargon that gets thrown around.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing you should come away with in learning about video resolution: there are many ways to describe the same thing.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s begin with aspect ratio, the width of an image divided by its height. Long ago and far away when televisions started inching their way into American homes, film studios combated the perceived threat of the medium by expanding the size of the theater screen. As a result, films have an aspect ratio of 16:9, while TV has an aspect ratio of 4:3. That&#8217;s the simple history of aspect ratios.</p>
<p>Now comes the hard part.</p>
<p><span id="more-251"></span></p>
<p>4:3 and 16:9 can be expressed as a lot of other numbers &#8212; 0.9091, 1.2121, 1.333, 320&#215;240, 640&#215;480, 720&#215;480, 1280&#215;720, 1980&#215;1080. By means confusing and technical, all these numbers represent the various ways video is displayed in 4:3 and 16:9, despite the fact some of these numbers don&#8217;t even express that proportion.</p>
<p>It has to do, in part, with scan lines.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://hometheater.about.com/cs/television/a/aavideoresa.htm">About.com</a> article describes it best:</p>
<blockquote><p>A television or recorded video image is basically made up of <strong>scan lines</strong>. Unlike film, in which the whole image is projected on a screen at once, a video image is composed of rapidly scanning lines across a screen starting at the top of the screen and moving to bottom.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though the image you see on the screen may be 4:3, the video resolution expresses the degree of granularity within that 4:3 aspect ratio. A 640&#215;480 resolution has a 4:3 aspect ratio. 640 / 480 = 1.333. A 720&#215;480 resolution also has a 4:3 aspect ratio. 720 / 480 = 1.5.</p>
<p>What? 1.333 is not the same as 1.5.</p>
<p>All right, let&#8217;s talk about standards. Different regions of the world have set specifications by which video makers and manufactures must abide. In North America, there&#8217;s NTSC. In Europe and Asia, there&#8217;s PAL. And there&#8217;s also SECAM, wherever that&#8217;s used. Each specification states how many scan lines can be used in video equipment.</p>
<p>That explains why the 480 doesn&#8217;t change between 640 and 720 &#8212; the specification deems it so.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the deal with the 640 and 720, then?</p>
<p>Scan lines deal with vertical resolution, but each line contains a number of dots &#8212; that is, pixels &#8212; that get fired up anytime that scanning beam of light hits it. The more lines and the more dots you have, the sharper the picture becomes.</p>
<p>Throwing all these numbers around won&#8217;t mean a thing without seeing just how messing with them affects your picture. Ever hear of letterboxing? It&#8217;s those black bars that show up on the top and bottom of your screen if you try to watch a 16:9 film image on a 4:3 TV set. If you tried to watch a 4:3 image on a 16:9 screen, the black bars would show up on sides.</p>
<p>Try to fill the entire space with the image, and it gets distorted. The narrow picture on a widescreen gets stretched, while a wide image on a narrow screen gets squished. Take out the distortion, and the image gets clipped.</p>
<p>In the audio world, it&#8217;s best to cut than to boost, and that still applies to video as well. Analog images look terrible on high definition screens because of the differences in scan lines &#8212; the 480 vertical lines of an analog signal can&#8217;t possible fill all 720 lines of a hi-def screen. It&#8217;s like transcoding a 128kbps MP3 to 192kbps &#8212; it&#8217;s still going to sound like a 128kbps MP3.</p>
<p>So if you want to watch a video shot at 320&#215;480 on a DVD player, you cannot help but have a fuzzy picture. And if you transcode a high definition video to standard definition &#8212; no, I&#8217;m not even going to get into what those terms mean &#8212; then try to upload to a site that supports high definition, you get a letterboxing double whammy.</p>
<p>Combine these concepts with the lesson about <a href="http://www.gregbueno.com/index.php/sakufu/entry/3743/">codecs</a>, and &#8230; well crap, my brain just shut down trying to keep all of it together.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s still much more to learn.</p>

I picture someone who draws attention to themselves by the sheer force of their software engineering acumen, coupled with an over-sized ego and an even bigger dope addiction.</p>
<p>&quot;Rock star developer&quot; <a href="http://advice.cio.com/esther_schindler/rockstar">used to mean one thing but now is meaning something else</a>. I sometimes look at those job postings and wonder if these employers would prefer a &quot;classical developer&quot; instead.</p>
<p>I am a classically-trained musician, although you wouldn&#8217;t know it if you heard me try to bang through the Tocatta by Aram Khachaturian. When I was learning the first movement of Ludwig Van Beethoven&#8217;s Moonlight Sonata, I wasn&#8217;t concentrating on the individual notes so much as I was listening for the overall harmonic rhythm. I could sense when one diminished seventh would fake out a resolution to another diminished seventh, till it finally reached the tonic, which was not necessarily in the root key established at the start of the piece.</p>
<p><span id="more-250"></span></p>
<p>Do you play music? Did all that sound like gibberish to you? It&#8217;s probably because you weren&#8217;t subjected to four semesters of music theory, which is the music major&#8217;s equivalent to organic chemistry. If you don&#8217;t survive the theory classes, you were pretty much persuaded to switch majors.</p>
<p>But some musicians don&#8217;t need to speak that language. In fact, most musicians never speak that language. They just develop an instinct for what sounds &quot;right&quot;. U2 prided themselves on the fact their earliest songs were nothing more than music exercises jumbled up to become songs. (On some level, though, that&#8217;s how it&#8217;s supposed to work.)</p>

<p>Of course, the hazard of having classical training is being shackled by it, and no world is more inflexible than classical music. <em>What&#8217;s on the page is what should be coming out of your instrument.</em> That is the rule of law, and audiences will let you know when you break it.</p>
<p>The trick, then, is to lean on that training without being beholden to it. When I work on my <a href="http://www.eponymous4.com/">own material</a>, I&#8217;ll keep in mind what the common chord progressions are &#8212; then try to find ways around them.</p>

";s:12:"atom_content";s:4523:"<p>I always have to snicker whenever I see a job posting asking for &quot;rock star developers&quot;. What does that mean? I picture someone who draws attention to themselves by the sheer force of their software engineering acumen, coupled with an over-sized ego and an even bigger dope addiction.</p>
<p>&quot;Rock star developer&quot; <a href="http://advice.cio.com/esther_schindler/rockstar">used to mean one thing but now is meaning something else</a>. I sometimes look at those job postings and wonder if these employers would prefer a &quot;classical developer&quot; instead.</p>
<p>I am a classically-trained musician, although you wouldn&#8217;t know it if you heard me try to bang through the Tocatta by Aram Khachaturian. When I was learning the first movement of Ludwig Van Beethoven&#8217;s Moonlight Sonata, I wasn&#8217;t concentrating on the individual notes so much as I was listening for the overall harmonic rhythm. I could sense when one diminished seventh would fake out a resolution to another diminished seventh, till it finally reached the tonic, which was not necessarily in the root key established at the start of the piece.</p>
<p><span id="more-250"></span></p>
<p>Do you play music? Did all that sound like gibberish to you? It&#8217;s probably because you weren&#8217;t subjected to four semesters of music theory, which is the music major&#8217;s equivalent to organic chemistry. If you don&#8217;t survive the theory classes, you were pretty much persuaded to switch majors.</p>
<p>But some musicians don&#8217;t need to speak that language. In fact, most musicians never speak that language. They just develop an instinct for what sounds &quot;right&quot;. U2 prided themselves on the fact their earliest songs were nothing more than music exercises jumbled up to become songs. (On some level, though, that&#8217;s how it&#8217;s supposed to work.)</p>

<p>Any explanation of digital video begins with an understanding coders and decoders. The proper parlance for this concept is <em>codec</em>. This word is important to learn. Take it to heart.</p>
<p>Digital video takes up a lot of space, much, much more than audio. An uncompressed audio file can be dozens of megabytes. An uncompressed video file can be dozens, even hundreds, of gigabytes. Back in the late &#8217;90s, when I made my first tip-toe into the depths of digital audio, 6GB hard drives felt voluminous, but they were no match for the demands of space-hogging WAV files.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s late-aught hard drives make those 6GB drives look puny, so a 100MB WAV file doesn&#8217;t seem so greedy. But even a 1.5-terabyte drive is no match for hours of uncompressed video files. Till such a day comes when drive space approaches infinity, codecs are a fact of life.</p>
<p>And damn are there a lot of them.</p>
<p><span id="more-249"></span></p>
<p>Of course, you could head on over to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codec">teh Wikipediaz</a> to get an explanation of what a codec is. For our purposes, we can think of it as the way a video is compressed, then decompressed, and each codec represents some method of compression and decompression that affects the quality of the picture.</p>
<p><em>Lossy</em> codecs discard information during encoding, similar to how a WAV file loses part of its frequency range when being converted to MP3. <em>Lossless</em> codecs do not discard information during encoding, similar to how a FLAC file compresses a WAV file without loss of sound quality.</p>
<p>Between the rock of hard drive space and the hard place of video file size, lossy codecs are pretty much de rigeur when working with digital video. To the home studio enthusiast, that&#8217;s like recording a song with nothing but MP3s and MP4s. Oh, it could be done, but the basic tenet of <em>any</em> media editing is that you want to cut more than boost.</p>
<p>Actually, keep that idea in mind throughout your exploration of any creative endeavor: <em>cut before boost</em>.</p>
<p>So in terms of digital video, you&#8217;ll be working with source that&#8217;s pretty much cut to begin with. I did not realize this fact during my first steps in dealing with video, so I ended up transcoding a lot of video. But similar to how coding and re-encoding a sound file will eventually screw up the sound quality, the effects on digital video are compounded moreso.</p>
<p>Transcoding is a necessity when working with video, but <em>smart</em> transcoding saves time and space.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s make this personal.</p>
<p>My first music video was shot on a Canon Powershot S500 point-and-shoot camera from 2003. It could record 30 seconds of video at 640&#215;480 or 3 minutes at 320&#215;240. Translation: It could record 30 seconds of video viewable on an old television set or 3 minutes viewable on 2005 state-of-the-art YouTube.</p>
<p>I opted to go for the smaller file size.</p>
<p>I eventually wanted to view this video on a DVD, despite its resolution. The concept of <em>resolution</em> requires another tutorial entirely, but for now let&#8217;s map some of these numbers being thrown around with real-life environments:</p>
<ul>
<li> A <strong>320&#215;240</strong> video can be viewed, as mentioned before, on YouTube at its lowest settings. It won&#8217;t look any good bigger than that.</p>
<li> A <strong>640&#215;480</strong> video can be viewed in iTunes or other desktop computer media players such as Windows Media Player and Winamp. You might even watch it on a television, but it won&#8217;t have the same picture quality as &#8230;
<li> A <strong>720&#215;480</strong> video, which is DVD quality and no better. It is certainly not hi-def, which is &#8230;
<li> A <strong>1920&#215;1280</strong> video, right now the best picture quality around, with <strong>1280&#215;1040</strong> still being pretty damned decent. </ul>
<p>My video, being capped at 320&#215;240, has no chance of looking good at a DVD level, but in order to be burned on a DVD, it has to be transcoded to that resolution regardless.</p>
<p>Fine. I figured I may as well transcode the source material to the destination resolution, edit it and export at that resolution. So I transcoded those files without paying attention to which codec I was using and ended up with 10 files each nearly 1GB. The original files <em>combined</em> took up 230MB of space. But I have a big drive, so what&#8217;s the deal?</p>
<p>First, the codec mattered. I could have saved a lot of hard drive space by choosing the right codec for the job, and I didn&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t even know how I chose what I chose &#8212; probably some default setting &#8212; but if I used one designed <em>specifically</em> for DVDs, I could have shaved a few hundred megabytes from those encoded files.</p>
<p>But in reality, I didn&#8217;t need to transcode those file at all. In fact, I could have just worked with the files on hand and let the settings in Sony Vegas Movie Studio take care of the transcoding during export. The picture quality looked the same both ways, but one method saved hard drive space.</p>
<p>So what codec do you use? That&#8217;s a question that comes up numerous times, but for beginners, read the manual for your camera. My Canon Powershot S500 stored video in AVI files with the MJPEG codec. My newer camera, a Canon Powershot SD780IS bought to replace the now-dead S500, stores video in MOV files with the H.264 codec.</p>
<p>Your camera will be different.</p>
<p>If you use a paid software video editor such as Vegas Movie Studio (the one I use) or iMovie, it should come with its own set of codecs to create whatever video you want to produce &#8212; DVD, Blu Ray, YouTube. If you use freeware such as VirtualDub, you&#8217;ll have to hunt for your own codecs.</p>
