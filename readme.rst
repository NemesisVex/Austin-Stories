Austin Stories
==============

Austin Stories is an aggregator for online journals (otherwise known as "weblogs") published by writers in Austin, Texas. The site stopped accepting new registrations in 2009 and now runs only as an archive.

History
-------

Austin Stories started as a static list of online journal writers in Austin, Texas. As the list grew, management of the list was handle by a custom script, which eventually evolved into a system where writers could sign up and maintain their listing.

About this repository
---------------------

Austin Stories was first powered by a custom-built management system until 2008, when it was refactored to use the CodeIgniter framework with the Smarty template library.

Development on Austin Stories froze in 2009. The code in this repository reflects my skill level at the time.
